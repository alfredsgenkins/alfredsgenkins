# Hi there 👋

I am Alfred Genkin. Also known as Alfreds Genkins. Why so? Well, I am from Latvia, here, every man name and surname ends with an "s". Cool fact, isn't it?

I started coding at the age of 10. My first programming teacher threw markers at me. I was not a good student. Despite this unpleasant fact, I grew up loving programming. This journey got me to my current project [ScandiPWA](github.com/scandipwa). Let's talk this project later. For now, let's consider my main goals and passions.

## 🤤 Passions

I love coding, when it is easy to. Development experience improvement is one of my main goals. How do I approach this?

- 👨‍🏫 Workshops and tutorials. I love teaching my community.
- 🗜 Tools for IDEs. The automation is a key for fast delivery.
- ⚠️ Tools for code-linting and CR automation. Quality and consistency.
- 📒 Docs. A lot of docs. Many iterations, a lot of theory.
- 👯‍♂️ Community. Daily Q&A are hard. Thankfully, they help many.

Another thing I love is theory learning. The specifications are so entertaining. One day, there will be one for my project too. I love digging deep, understanding how things work. Browser paints, Javascript libraries, accessibility and many, many other tricky things are soo breath-taking!

So, besides development-experience I love digging following areas:

- 🎢 Performance. Optimization is a pain with benefits.
- ♿️ Accessibility. Because it is awesome to care.
- 🏭 Automation. The legit way to clone myself.

Finally, I love competition. When I have time, I do https://cssbattle.dev/. Console games - nah... I ❤️ CSS-battles. My top 1 recommendation for trick learning and self-improvement in CSS and HTML.

## 🚀 Goals

Struggling with this part. I always have some in mind for my product, less often personally. That's why, my number one goal is:

- 🔝 ScandiPWA improvement and development.

Next is probably **Awareness**. I want to know my tools best.

## 💼 Projects

- [ScandiPWA](github.com/scandipwa) the best PWA theme for Magento 2.
- [Asyncei](github.com/alfredsgenkins/asyncei) the HTML lazy-loading library.

I worked and contributed to a lot of other projects too. I helped to launch hell-lot of web-stores. I thank every human being I teamed up with. If you are reading this - remember you are awesome! 🥰
